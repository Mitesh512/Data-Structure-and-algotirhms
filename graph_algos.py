        What is a Bipartite Graph?
            A graph is bipartite if:
            You can split its nodes into two sets, say U and V
            Such that no two nodes in the same set are connected
            Another way to say it: you can color the graph using only 2 colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.

        Intution:

            Think of a bipartite graph as a "no triangle between 3 friends" network.
            If one node is red, all its neighbors must be blue, and their neighbors must be red again, and so on.
            If you ever find two adjacent nodes with the same color, the graph is not bipartite.
