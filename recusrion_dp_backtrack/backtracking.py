What Is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a refined form of recursion where you:
Make a choice â†’ Explore â†’ Undo the choice â†’ Try next option

It's perfect for solving problems where:
    You need to explore all combinations/paths.
    There are constraints, and you prune invalid paths early.
    Examples include: permutations, combinations, N-Queens, Sudoku, Word Search.
    
    
def backtrack(state, choices):
    if goal_reached(state):
        save_solution(state)
        return

    for choice in choices:
        if is_valid(choice, state):
            make_choice(state, choice)
            backtrack(state, choices)
            undo_choice(state, choice)  # <--- backtrack
            
Let's Translate to an Example
Let's revisit your permutation example and apply in-place backtracking logic.

Google Interview Scenario
You're working on an internal tagging engine at Google that assigns different combinations of expertise tags 
(like "ml", "ai", "cv") to user profiles for recommendation systems.
To test all configurations, your task is to generate all unique orderings of the tags provided.
You are not allowed to use additional memory like slicing or creating new arrays in each recursive call.
Implement this using in-place backtracking.

Google Cloud Resource Allocation
You're working as a systems engineer on Google Cloud Platform. 
A client has a daily resource budget (in units of compute time). 
They provide you with a list of tasks, each task consuming a fixed amount of compute units.

Your task is to determine if it's possible to allocate some subset of these tasks such

If yes, return one such subset of tasks that meets the exact requirement. 
If not, return an empty list or None.

ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement (Formalized)
Given a list of tasks, where each task is represented by its compute cost (a positive integer),
