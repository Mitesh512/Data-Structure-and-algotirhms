Problem:
 1: Friend Circles
üß† Google-style framing:
Imagine you're designing a social graph for a small internal tool at Google.
Each employee can be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with other employees.
Friendship is bidirectional and transitive ‚Äî meaning if A is friends with B and B is friends with C, then A is friends with C.

You're given a 2D matrix M of size n x n where M[i][j] = 1 means employee i and j are friends.

Return the number of friend circles (i.e., distinct groups of connected employees).
üîß Constraints:
1 <= n <= 200
M[i][j] == 1 means friendship, M[i][j] == M[j][i]
Every employee is friends with themselves: M[i][i] == 1

Solution:
This looks like finding number of islands, I can use DFS to find all distinct groups
start traversing the matring from top left to bottom right
if I find 1 , I will first increase the count of friend circle, and apply dfs
since it is connected in 4 directions to avoid going to cases which I have seen earlier I 
can have a visited set.

"""Problem 3: Accounts Merge
üß† Google-style framing:
Imagine you're building a system for Google Contacts where users can save email addresses across multiple accounts. If two accounts share even a single common email, they should be merged into one.
You're given a list of accounts. Each account is a list where:
The first element is the user's name.
The remaining elements are email addresses.

Merge accounts that belong to the same person (i.e., if they share at least one email), and return the merged accounts in the same format:   
[
 ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
 ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"],
 ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"],
 ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]
]

[
 ["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com'],
 ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"],
 ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]
]

Approach:
We know a list that starts with name and its emails
the name can appear multiple times
you can merge lists where name is common and at least one email from the list

can these names be different for same email, like john, John , Johnny? No names will be standard only

Since we need to find matching email and merge it or connect it, this can be solved using disjoint sets

We can do something like convert list to indices because i need to connect the list so I need the count.
so create like 
disjoin_set(len(accounts))
since names will be standard I can assign the name as like indices, so that I can merge on basis of indices.

0: ["johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
1: [ "johnnybravo@mail.com"],
2: ["johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"],
3: ["mary@mail.com"]

{"johnsmith@mail.com":0,
"john00@mail.com":0,
 "johnnybravo@mail.com":1,
 "johnsmith@mail.com":2
}

this becomes like adjacency list
0 is connected to ["johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
2 is connected to ["johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"] 


I will iterate for each account and if I find any email which is common I will connect them
So Basically I need to connect email to accounts

Explanation:
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.

- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land. We have 2 islands.

Next Google-Type Problem: Evaluate Division
üß† (Leetcode 399)
üìå Why Google likes this:
Graph traversal with mapping.
Reasoning over transitive relations (like currency conversion, units, knowledge graphs).
Often used to test DFS/BFS, hash maps, and data modeling skills.

You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values,
where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.
You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.
Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.
Note: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.

Example 1:
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]

Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? 
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
note: x is undefined => -1.0
